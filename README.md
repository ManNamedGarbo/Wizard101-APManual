# Wizard101-Manual-Apworld
A Wizard101 randomizer apworld intended for use with Archipelago built using Manual,

## How does this work?
You begin a run with a brand new free-to-play wizard of the school you specified in your yaml; then you complete quests in order to unlock equipment, new zones, and more with your eventual goal of killing the Kraken in Triton Avenue and turning in the quest "Decease the Kraken" to complete the randomizer.
## What do I start with, if anything?
- You can wear your starter equipment, but if you wish you upgrade them you will need to receive the appropriate equipment slot through the multiworld; i.e. "Unlock Robes" will allow you to equip robes that aren't your starter robes. If you want the true wizlocke-style experience, you should also disable free spells from your starter deck/wand until you unlock those slots.
- You cannot use treasure cards unless the ability to do so is sent to you.
- You cannot use mounts, treasure cards, training points, flasks, or pets until they are unlocked. Once you unlock them you can use them as much as you like. It is against the spirit of the free to play version to use anything from the crowns shop so do with that what you will, I'm not your dad.
## Is there anything about logic I should know?
- Only set ONE school to true in the yaml, or it almost certainly will cause generation to fail.
- You cannot warp to your house unless you have the "Ravenwood Access" and "Your Home Access" items.
- You do not need the quest for the Smiths in order to complete the check for finding them. You just need to walk onto them (It is recommended you have the quest though)
- In order to access Kraken Isle, you must receive the five Kraken Isle Key Pieces. Once you have these logic will allow you to enter the Kraken Teleporter (assuming you have proper quest progress and zone access).
- If you **RECEIVE** a deathlink, you should either flee battle or immediately teleport to the commons. If neither can be done I recommend just swapping realms. You should **SEND** a deathlink if you are defeated in battle or flee for any reason.
